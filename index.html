        <p>The directory will live on the Ethereum blockchain, a decentralized network of high censorship-resistance.</p>
        <p>Features of the directory:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The directory will be open and accessible by anyone throughout the world</li>
            <li>The directory itself will have no paywalls, licenses, or gatekeepers</li>
            <li>The directory will be collectively owned</li>
            <li>The owner of a podcast will have the sole ability to add or change that podcast's information in the directory</li>
            <li>The directory will be a hedge against any encroaching centralization amongst other podcast directories</li>
            <li>To the maximum extent technically possible, the directory will live indefinitely</li>
        </ul>
